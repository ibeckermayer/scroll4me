- When a user clicks generate digest from the menu the app should pop open directly to the digest file
- Get rid of the going into replies feature for now, needs more thorough thought on how to do it properly
- Get rid of most of the feed selectors in selectors.go. Create raw .js files that we load so we can just define consts in JS and get a more normal dev experience.
- Handle quote tweets better: currently we skip "Show more" on quote tweets because clicking them navigates to the quoted tweet's page. Should follow those links to get full quoted content for the digest. Note: this causes navigation away from feed, so either open in a new tab or remember to navigate back afterwards.
- cookies are stored unencrypted on disk right now, as is config (which contains api keys). We should encrypt them at rest.
- Add a feature that let's the LLM select something outside of your interests to help you discover new things.
- Capture logs and errors to a file so we can debug issues.
